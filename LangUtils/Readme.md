* `po_make.php` - Assemble the body of a target language PO file with keys and translated strings being alternated.
* `GoogleLangCodes.txt` - Google Language Codes to be used in forming URLS for translation
* `makefile.php` - Script to download a session variable on the fly as a .txt file
* `php-mo.php` - Library for gettext po/mo conversions [on GitHub](https://github.com/phpmo/php.mo)

## HowTo Translate

* Using a PO/POT file of a translation template, obtain the Translation Keys
* Place the Translation Keys in a html file and use the URL in Google Translate
* Get the output of Google Translate into a Translated Strings file and correct them manually
* Use the bash file to separate out an existing translated PO file and obtain it's headers, keys, translated strings and key/string pairs.
* Compare the existing keys split by bash with and those split from the template and correct them to get a single Keys file
* Merge the original bash split header (or a newly prepared one) with the key/string pairs generated by the po_make.php script to get the final PO file
* Upload this final PO file in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com) and review the strings and fill in the missing ones and download the proofed PO file
* Use the likes of POEdit to convert/compile this proofed PO file into a MO file and use it in the target application.
* Convert PO to MO in PHP using [php.mo](https://github.com/phpmo/php.mo) | [MO Format](http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gettext/manual/html_node/MO-Files.html) | [PO Format](http://pology.nedohodnik.net/doc/user/en_US/ch-poformat.html)
* The format for Google Translation online is `http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=auto&tl=hi&u=http://www.mydomain.tld/mypage.html` where `sl` is the soucre language, `tl` is the target language and `u` is the URL to be translated.
* [This site based on Google Translate](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/translationform) does so with no limits.
